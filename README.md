ClipSVC must be stopped in Task Manager > Services

You must have Minecraft Trial Edition installed via the Microsoft Store.



There has recentaly been a problem with this tool. After you shutdown or restart your device, the next boot up or the next few boot ups will seem normal until you complete the log-in screen you will be prompted with a black screen and only your cursor.
Here is how to fix that:

Method 1 - Press Ctrl+Shift+Esc and click on `File`. Next, click on `Run new task`. A task will pop up. Type `explorer`.

Method 2 - Press Ctrl+Shift+Esc and click on `File`. Next, click on `Run new task`. A task will pop up. Make sure `Create this task with adminstarative privilieges` is checked. Type `cmd`. Type in `net start ClipSVC`.

Method 3 - Open the `fixblackscreen.reg` file included in this repository and restart your computer after.
